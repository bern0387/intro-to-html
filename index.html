            <p>My name is Milo Berniqué and I am 18 years old. I am bilingual [french and english] and pride myself on being good at arts. I use he/they pronouns and am punk [would also consider myself in the emo, goth and scene subcultures].</p>

            <p>Apart from Graphic Design, I enjoy fashion, dancing and other forms of visual arts [drawing, painting and etc]. I am a very politically involved person and am very extroverted and outgoing [though I may seem shy and quiet in class].</p>
